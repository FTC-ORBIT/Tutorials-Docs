Git
===================================
What is Git?
--------
 Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management.
 It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently.
 Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

Basic git commands:
--------

git commit
~~~~~~~~~~
Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch to point to that new commit.
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git commit -m 'committing added changes'

git clone
~~~~~~~~~~
Creates a GIT repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions.
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:user/test.git

git add
~~~~~~~~~~
Adds files changes in your working directory to your index.
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git add ..

git status
~~~~~~~~~~
Shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory. It will list out files that are untracked (only in your working directory), modified (tracked but not yet updated in your index), and staged (added to your index and ready for committing).
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git status
    _On branch master 
 Initial commit 
 Untracked files: 
 (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) #
 _

git config
~~~~~~~~~~
Sets configuration values for your user name, email, gpg key, preferred diff algorithm, file formats and more.
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git config --global user.email "user@domain.com"
    $ git config --global user.name "My Name"

git init
~~~~~~~~~~
Initializes a git repository â€“ creates the initial .git directory in a new or in an existing project.
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/customer/GIT/.git/

git pull
~~~~~~~~~~
Fetches the files from the remote repository and merges it with your local one.
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git pull origin

git push
~~~~~~~~~~
Pushes all the modified local objects to the remote repository and advances its branches.
 .. code-block:: console

    $ git push
